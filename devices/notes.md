The Notes tab can be used to record special notes pertaining to the device. This could be as simple as recording defects in the equipment, unknown damage, or other discrepancies found.

## Adding a New Note

Scrolling to the bottom of the "note conversation" screen will allow you to type into the box and press `Reply`. This will submit your note and reload the screen, adding your note to the conversation box.
