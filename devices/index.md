# Device Management

Devices in Manage1to1 can be anything in your district you wish to track. While intended to track 1:1 devices, many Manage1to1 customers have replaced their entire Asset Management system with Manage1to1 due to the versitility and no added cost to track devices. Below are various sections that will outline the features as well as the possible functions that are able to be performed.

## Device Profile

The Device Profile is accessible via `Devices >> View Devices`, the Global Search, associated Users and Invoices, and various other locations throughout Manage1to1.

- [Device Information Tab](devices/device-information.md)
- [Incident History Tab](devices/incident-history.md)
- [Insurance Tab](devices/insurance.md)
- [User History Tab](devices/user-history.md)
- [Notes Tab](devices/notes.md)

## Adding a New Device

![Adding a Device](../_media/screenshots/add-adevice.png ':size=50%')

Adding a new device can be done via a few methods. This method is the preferred method when adding a single Device or a small handful of Devices. For larger quantities of devices, we recommend using an import.
 
 To get started, navigate to `Devices >> Add a Device` on the left sidebar menu. You will then be directed to a page that allows you to fill out the information necessary to add the user to Manage1to1.
  
?> Fields marked with an asterisk (*) in Manage1to1 are required.

### Add Device Column

**Status** - Does the device you are adding need a special status? Choose the appropriate option here.
**Date Purchased** - This is important to help keep track of device rotations, you can use the purchase date or "in-service" date here.
**Model Number** - This is the model number of the device. You can create custom models here.
**Operating System** - This is the installed operating system of the device to be added. Operating Systems can be customized here.
**Serial #** - The unique manufacturer identifying number of the device.
**Asset Tag** - This is a unique identifier, which can be the same as the serial number, or could be a barcode which can be used throughout Manage1to1.
**Loaner** - (Optional) Check this box to mark this device as a loaner device.
**Loaner Number** - (Optional) Required when Loaner is Clicked - A numerical identifier for this loaner device.
- **Custom Fields** - (Optional) Any custom fields that you have created will be displayed at the bottom of the left column, in your configured order.

### Building Assignment Column

This column allows you to assign this device to a specific building. This is optional and by default typically you would leave this set to "All Buildings".

?> Setting a device to a specific building will prevent Manage1to1 administrators that do not have the building permission from seeing the device in all areas of Manage1to1.
