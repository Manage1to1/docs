# Device Management

Devices in Manage1to1 can be anything in your district you wish to track. While intended to track 1:1 devices, many Manage1to1 customers have replaced their entire Asset Management system with Manage1to1 due to the versitility and no added cost to track devices. Below are various sections that will outline the features as well as the possible functions that are able to be performed.

## Device Profile

The Device Profile is accessible via `Devices >> View Devices`, the Global Search, associated Users and Invoices, and various other locations throughout Manage1to1.

- [Device Information Tab](devices/device-information.md)
- [Incident History Tab](devices/incident-history.md)
- [Insurance Tab](devices/insurance.md)
- [User History Tab](devices/user-history.md)
- [Notes Tab](devices/notes.md)

## Adding a New Device

![Adding a User](../_media/screenshots/add-a-user.png ':size=50%')

Adding a new user can be done via a few methods. This method is the preferred method when adding a single User or a small handful of users. For larger quantities of users, we
 recommend using an import.
 
 To get started, navigate to `Users >> Add a User` on the left sidebar menu. You will then be directed to a page that allows you to fill out the information necessary to add the
  user to Manage1to1.
  
?> Fields marked with an asterisk (*) in Manage1to1 are required.

- **User Type** - Is the user you are adding a student or staff member? Choose the appropriate option here.
- **Local ID Number** - This is the internal ID number used to reference this user. (It should match your SIS records).
- **State ID Number** - (Optional) This is the number used by your governing body to manage the student.
- **Username** - (Optional) Enter the username you wish to assign for this user. If left blank, a username will be generated in the format specified in `Settings >> General
 Settings`.
- **Password** - (Optional) Enter the password you wish to assign for this user. If left blank, a password will be generated.
- **Email** - (Optional) Enter the email address you wish to assign for this user. If left blank, the email will be generated in the form of username@domain.com
- **Apple ID Username/Password/Unlock Code** - (Optional) These fields only show up when enabled in the Settings page.
