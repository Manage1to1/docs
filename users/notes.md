The Notes tab can be used to record special notes pertaining to the user. This could be as simple as recording they need special equipment, they are hard on equipment, etc.

## Adding a New Note

Scrolling to the bottom of the "note conversation" screen will allow you to type into the box and press `Reply`. This will submit your note and reload the screen, adding your note to the conversation box.
